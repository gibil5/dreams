Do things for her, pay your karma...
For the first in life. Pay your karma. 
Take things seriously. Things are concrete and real, not virtual. 
Accept what she wants to give you. Like massages. 


Remember what Susana said. 
Are you ready to bet on her ? 
If so, give her space. But show her in subtle ways that you love her. 
And when she feels like it, she will come back. Be patient. And show her your love. 
Heal with the help of Susana. She is your new frontier. 

Work with Susana and Ana. Talk to Lama Karma Chotso.
On the path of the hungry ghosts. That, sometimes, take posession of you. 
Which explains how painful things can become, inside a relationship. 
And how sadly peaceful and empty you feel when you are alone. 

How your love is stongly related to dead people. 
How emptyness (vacum) is what you really are. 

Work on the conversation you had with her. 
On liberation, by writing what you are not. Which leaves space for emptyness. 


Ali has not cut all bridges. She is generating exchanges, to see how you react. 
To see if she is able to trust you again. 
She realizes how close we are. Most of all, from a subconscious perspective. 
But she is still afraid of suffering. 
Keep generating encounters. Because, this is what is going to actualize the real feelings 
you have for each other. 
Remember the things that unite you. And work on that.

spirituality. 

S. represents an alternative for her, but with renouncement of the world. 
What keeps strong ties with the world is her son. 
Amazed of realizing that she almost took a monastic path, while you were doing the vipasana. 
Strange coincidence.
She has come back to the world and you can be part of it. 
Dont try to be like him. 
Build what makes you profoundly different from him. 
You are capable of generating money. He is not. 
You have a house and a familiy. He has not. 
Build on your differences. 

But still, be deeply spiritual. 
Accept your dreams and visions. Not from a metaphoric point of view. Explicitly jungian. 
Write. And show her what you wrote. 
Keep playing mridanga with Gopal. 
Keep learning buddhism. 
Become a deep meditator. Learn interesting technics. 
Keep your exchanges deep and strong.

- Help her with her blog. 
- Take good picures of her painting and send them. 
- Give her money for a taxi, each time she comes to your home. 
- Buy her what she craves. Even, if you know that it is bad for her health. 


In the long term... 
- Understand that her son is her biggest source of anxiety. Help her solve that. 
First, listening to all her complaints. Without saying anything. 
Then, try to give some useful advice. 
Then, show her that with you she can have a stable life. To get her son back. 
To have more children. 
- Work a lot to provide a cash flow, in order to be able to do all those things. 
Work, work, work...
- Work on intentions. Keep them pure. 


She has realized that she is not completely ready to become a krisna. 

Keep closeness with her.
