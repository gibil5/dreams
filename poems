Poem
------

No longer love should be built upon fear. 

The rule is to love only those who give us their intimacy. 
Those looking for intensity will have to wait,
freezing cold behind the gates of our skin. 

Fire will never again be mistaken for what it is not. 
Only the prelude of cold ashes and dust. 
While warmth is the indicator of long lasting proximity, 
and the true beacon for two similar beings
walking together through the same path.
